# Introduction

```
Monax is an application platform for building, testing, maintaining, and
operating applications built to run on an ecosystem level.
```

`monax` is a tool which makes it easy for developers to build, test, manage, and operate smart contract applications. **No matter the blockchain**.

[For the motivation behind this tool see this post](https://monax.io/platform/motivation).

# Install (For Developers)

* Install Docker.
* Install Go.

```
go get github.com/monax/monax/cmd/monax
monax init
```

See below for the directory structure created by `init`.

# Install (For Non-Developers)

Please see our [getting started page](https://monax.io/docs/getting-started) for those who are not familiar with go and/or docker.

# Overview

The `monax` tool is centered around a very few concepts:

* `services` — things that you turn on or off
* `chains` — develop permissioned chains
* `pkgs` — our smart contract tool chain
* `keys` — wrapping of our key management tooling

These concepts provide the core functionality of what we think a true smart contract application platform requires.

To get started using `monax` to see what the tooling can do and how it can help your development patterns for smart contract applications, please see our [tutorial series](https://monax.io/docs).

# Architecture of the Tool

`monax` is mostly an opinionated wrapper around Docker's API. We have found that running applications locally which require sophisticated installation paths and/or complex configuration work best when used from Docker's container based system.

Each of the `concepts` listed above is described in a bit more detail below.

## Services

Services are "things that you turn on or off". Examples of services include:

* a PGP daemon
* an IPFS node
* a Bitcoin node
* an Ethereum node
* a Tendermint test chain node
* BigchainDB service
* ZCash node

Services work from a base of **service definition files**. These files are held on the host in the following location: `~/.monax/services`. Service definition files tell `monax` how a docker container should be started. The specification for service definition files is located [here](https://monax.io/docs/specs/services_specification).

To see the various ways in which `monax` can interact with services, please type:

```
monax services
```

## Chains

Chains are an opinionated toolchain around permissioned chains. They can be most easily thought of as your "develop" branch for chains. In other words, if you need to work **on** a permissioned chain, then it is best to use `monax chains`. Chains hardcode most of the service starting criteria, but still allow for some flexibility as to how chains are worked with.

To see the various ways in which `monax` can help you develop chains, please type:

```

```

## Pkgs

Pkgs are an opinionated toolkit to help you deploy and test your smart contract packages on both permissioned and unpermissioned blockchain networks.

`monax pkgs` is a package manager to deal with contracts. The package manager is a yaml based automation framework which makes it trivial to deploy and test your smart contract systems. The specification for `monax:jobs` definition files is located [here](https://monax.io/docs/specs/jobs_specification).

Pkgs give you access to test your smart contracts both against "throwaway chains" which are one time use chains that are needed for the sole purpose of testing smart contract packages, as well as existing blockchain networks.

```

```

## Keys

Keys is an opinionated toolchain around [monax-keys](https://github.com/monax/keys). Please note that this concept of the `monax` platform is **for development only** and should not be used in production because it has not been fully security audited **and we do not plan for it to be**. In production the keys service should be replaced with your audited security system of choice.

To see the various ways in which `monax` can help you manage your various key pairs, please type:

```
monax keys
```
